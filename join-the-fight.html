<h2>We Need Your Help!</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of the hackathon ultimately isn’t to win prizes, it’s to build
  useful apps that people can use to manage and survive during the COVID-19
  pandemic. What started in Edmonton, Canada as a discussion amongst developers
  on the Dev Edmonton Society Slack has exploded into a global initiative to
  improve people's quality of live and fight the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
  With participants in over 10 countries around world, it's a growing movement.
  Anyone interested in helping out is invited to join the fight and get
  involved!
