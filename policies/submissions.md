1. **(Optional)** For open-source projects, we encourage a link to the source code repository (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

### Final Competition Submission

Along with the [Deliverables](#deliverables) above, teams **must also include the following** when submitting for final consideration:

- A **[public/unlisted](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) YouTube URL** to your pitch and demo (**3 minutes or less, see ["Pitch Video"](#pitch-video) for details and hints**)
- When submitting projects for final consideration, please ensure that the team is available during the judging period to answer questions about your project.
- During final judging some teams may be asked to meet with the judges via video conference. Please ensure some or all team members are available.
- Failure to communicate and answer questions from the judges may disadvantage your project's placement in the competition and could disqualify you from prizes.
- Projects may only be submitted for consideration in one prize category at a time, however you can submit your project multiple times and apply for more than one prize.

### Weekly Competition Submission

Along with the [Deliverables](#deliverables) above, teams **must also include the following** when submitting for weekly consideration:

1. Long description/pitch for your app we can use to describe your app to voters, judges, and the media.
1. Instructions for interacting with your app (if not included in the app itself).

Please remember:

- Your submission does not need to be complete, but you must be able to demonstrate it.
- Teams may submit their projects for multiple weekly considerations; however, new progress must be demonstrated leading up to each submission.
- Be sure to review the [Deliverables](#deliverables) and have them ready before we close submissions!

## Pitch Video

We've prepared a short video (under 3 minutes!) that both explains what you should do in your pitch video, and serves as an example of the type of video we're looking for. [Read the slides I shared in the video](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KsrRGj08XK-x3RKgTIdWszW2jqMSmqdLFCTlsT8l3Xw/edit?usp=sharing).

The key takeaways are:

1. Pretend you're talking to a room full of judges at the end of an in-person hackathon.
1. Don't worry about production quality. Focus on being clear, and convincing.
1. You don't need to speak or use a webcam, subtitles or descriptive text are ok. The judges understand that English is not everyone's first language.
1. If you do use a webcam and microphone please try to use proper lighting and a quality external microphone or headset. Stand up while you speak if possible.
1. Record mobile apps using a simulator on your desktop or the recorder on your device.
1. Open Broadcaster Studio is a great cross platform recording tool, but Mac and Windows have screen recording built in as well.
1. Only [PUBLIC or UNLISTED YouTube videos](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) under 3 minutes that don't require signing in to view will be accepted

In terms of content please make sure you:

1. Clearly say the name of your project and how to access it
1. Explain the problem you're solving and which problem area you're competing in
1. Explain how your project effectively solves your problem
1. Explain how your project has been made accessible to as many people as possible
1. Explain the impact your project has had (people helped to date, lives saved, businesses, etc.)
1. Ideally, your project should be easy enough to use that it doesn't require directions but if it does please demonstrate for the judges.
1. At the end mention again how to try your app and how to get help from your team
