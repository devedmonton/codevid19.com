## Summary

The CODEVID-19 Hackathon is divided into two phases. Weekly prizes are awarded until April 30th, when teams can submit their projects for the final prizes. Final prizes are awarded following a judging period.

Projects compete in four problem areas, and are evaluated on effectiveness, accessibility, and impact.

### The Problems

We're passionate about improving the quality of life for people during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic by addressing the following problems:

1. Supporting Crisis Response
2. Understanding The Pandemic
3. Social Distancing & Isolation
4. Scarcity & The Economy

#### Supporting Crisis Response

First responders, healthcare workers and emergency response managers are on the front lines of the pandemic. How can we help to work more effectively, safely, and quickly?

Examples of apps in this category might include services to crowd source reporting of crisis information, using machine learning and data science to quickly identify problems to be addressed, or allow more efficient distribution of health care and emergency resources.

#### Understanding The Pandemic

How can we better understand the current state of the pandemic and make informed decisions about the future? How do we evaluate and trust the information around us?

An app in this category might help provide verified answers to questions about COVID-19 and the pandemic, predict if the curve is being flattened, or help people report and filter out misinformation.

#### Social Distancing & Isolation

From working at home, assisting the elderly and at need, to entertaining and educating our children few parts of the pandemic more broadly impact society than the Social Isolation and Distancing we're all practicing.

How do we limit the impact and costs associated with Social Isolation and Distancing, and ensure that we're ready to pick up where we left off when we come back together?

Apps in this category might help connect people together, identify people in distress, facilitate remote working, on assist parents and educators continue classes.

#### Scarcity & The Economy

Economics is the study of scarcity, and during the pandemic it's a struggle to understand the situation and how to most effectively use limited resources to maximum effect.

How we better understand and manage the economic impacts, and use our resources most effectively to weather the largest economic change in modern history.

App in this category could include helping understand and manage changes in the work force, evaluate and track the effectiveness of government interventions, or better distribute scarce resources.

### Your Solution

We believe faster, more effective and more available solutions are preferred to slower, less useful and limited ones.

Therefore we will be judging projects on three main criteria:

1. **Effectiveness** - How well does this project address the problem it's attempting to solve?
2. **Accessibility** - How easily are people are able to access this project?
3. **Impact** - How many people have benefited from this project?

### Your Team

Teams of up to 5 people are welcome to participate. For legal reasons we require that all team members be 13 years or older as of May 16th at 00:00 UTC if they wish to participate.

### Weekly Competitions

For the majority of the event, teams may submit projects into a weekly competition. The winner is determined by a popular vote, and announced Tuesdays.

Teams must submit their apps by **Sunday, 23:59 UTC** and then the public has 24-hours from **Monday, 03:00 UTC** to **Tuesday, 03:00 UTC** to vote for their favourite. The winner will be announced by **Tuesday, 20:00 UTC**.

_This is a great opportunity to promote your project and CODEVID-19 to friends, family, and your network!_

### Final Competition

Teams also have until April 30th at 23:59 UTC to submit their projects for consideration for the final prizes.

These are larger prizes awarded to a winner and runner-up in four problem areas, as decided by a team of expert judges. There will also be final popular choice prize awarded at the end of the competition.

Judging begins once project submissions close, and we're aiming to complete it within one week.
