We're excited to congratulate **"Get Cleard"** and **"FoodSearchInc.com"** on winning this week's prize!

For the first time, we had a tie, so we’ve decided to award both teams the prize. In the future, we’ve updated the rules with some tie-breaking options.

## Get Cleard

Currently, nurses and other healthcare professionals are tasked with taking temperatures at hospitals. Enhanced health screening at airports takes too long to be enforced, and now identifying unhealthy people falls on CBSA officers.

In the near term the goal is to support front line workers such as nurses and CBSA officers to allow them to continue their core duties.

The long term goal of cleard.ai is to use the short term dataset created by supporting front line workers to train our AI so they can detect and predict infections in real-time.

FoodSearchInc.com connects sources of food to the people who need them and provides information that makes food more transparent and accessible. Local small businesses, especially in the food industry are currently in distress as people are unable to dine out.
