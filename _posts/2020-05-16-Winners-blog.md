title: Congratulations Winners of the Codevid-19 Global Hackathon!
---

We’re finally here, after an incredible amount of lightning speed and high intensity collaboration, feverish coding, massive organizational support, and generous sponsorship from our technology and media sponsors .  It takes a global village to create something like this; thank you all for making Codevid-19 a success. 

CODEVID-19 started in Edmonton, Canada when a group of programmers from the Dev Edmonton Society wanted to make a difference while stuck at home during the lockdown.  Edmonton is a city of just over a million people, and while oil is our main economic driver, we have a flourishing technology sector too.

The idea for a virtual hackathon was born and it quickly spread from Edmonton to Toronto, the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Over the past six weeks more than 1,800 people from 24 countries on 6/7 continents have participated.

Together they built over 60 projects to help mitigate the effects of increased domestic violence, visualize the spread of COVID-19, help consumers understand what’s in stock near them, or manage the toll of social isolation by connecting with someone for a meaningful and spontaneous conversation. 

We are very pleased to announce the winners in all five categories:

**Supporting Crisis Response Category**

Our first prize goes to one of the 9 teams competing in the *Supporting Crisis Response* problem area. First responders, healthcare workers, and emergency response managers are on the front lines of the pandemic. In many cases these people put their lives on the line to protect us all. Projects in this area aim to help community members on the front lines work more effectively, safely, and quickly.

**Runner up: Get Cleard**

[*Get Cleard*](https://get.cleard.ai/login) is a non-contact screening solution that automates symptom Q&A + EBT screening w/ thermal imaging. Creating ML baselines for frontline workers, anomaly detection, and alerts. *Get Cleard* uses data science to support our frontline heroes. Here is what the team had to say about their [project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMuoIDpw1qc).

** Category Winner: A.I. Powered Digital Hospital & Laboratory**

This team built an automated [A.I powered digital hospital and coronavirus laboratory](https://beta.covidcare.cloud) that will help in performing millions of COVID-19 tests each minute, and provide A.I monitored realtime doctor consultation to patients. They talk about their amazing project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KS7yZT4IM).

**Understanding the Pandemic Category**

The seven entrants in the *Understanding the Pandemic category worked to improve our understanding of the current state of the pandemic, find trustworthy information, and make informed decisions about the future.

**Runner up:  Covtrace**

**Social Distance and Isolation Category**

From working at home, assisting the elderly and others at need, and entertaining and educating our children, few parts of the pandemic more broadly impact society than the effects of social isolation. Projects in this category seek to mitigate the impact associated with the disruption to our society, and ensure that we’re ready to pick up where we left off when we come back together.

**Runner up: Vox of Life**

**Scarcity and the Economy Category**

Economics is the study of scarcity, and during this pandemic we have struggled to understand the situation and how to most effectively use limited resources to maximum effect. Projects in this category help us to better understand and manage the economic impact, and weather the largest economic shift in modern history.
